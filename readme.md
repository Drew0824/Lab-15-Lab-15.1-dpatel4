How can this be implemented in C++? Hint: You can use two predefined math functions (one of them twice) learned in this lesson. One of them will be “inside” the other.

Fill in the missing statement so that the following sample run is implemented: 

Please input the value of sides one 
**9** 
Please input the value of sides two
**3** 
The sides of the right triangle are 9 and 3 
The hypotenuse is 9.48683
